# YOLOv8 data config for 1-class objectness detection
# Used by Pipeline C: YOLO objectness + CNN classifier
#
# Same bounding boxes as yolo_14class.yaml, but all class IDs remapped to 0.
# Run training/prepare_objectness_labels.py to generate the remapped labels.
#
# Dataset structure expected:

#       images/   *.jpg  (symlinked or same as 14-class)
#       labels/   *.txt  (remapped: all class_id = 0)
